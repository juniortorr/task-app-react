# Tasker

# Project Description
This is a productivity app meant for keeping track of every day todo list items. It demonstrates full CRUD capabilities. You can create and edit projects and tasks for each project. This project leverages the local storage on your device to keep projects saved. Be careful though, as local storage is not necessarily intended for long term usage. The app is merely a beta. You can run this project by going here https://taskerprototype.netlify.app/ . Enjoy!

# Project Background
This project is actually a 'remastered' version if you will of an old vanilla javascript project that I had made for The Odin Project curriculum. I wanted to re construct it with React.js so that I could practice using react-dom and the internal react-router along with local storage. It truly amazes me how much simpler this project was with react and also how much personal growth I feel like I've made since that project, especially in how easy the responsive design felt. (The old code kinda looked gross. I can't imagine what I'll think of this code in even six months).

# Technology
Tasker is built using ReactJS and bundled with Vite. The dates are all formatted using Date-FNS. All storage is made by leveraging the local storage on your device.
